viá»‡tnamg and Writing in the middle of a file is as simple as using
a RandomAccessFile in Java. RandomAccessFile, despite its name,
is more like an InputStream and OutputStream and less like a File.
It allows you to read or seek through bytes in a file and then 
begin writing over whichever bytes you care to stop at.
Once you discover this class, it is very easy to use if 
you have a basic understanding of regular file i/o.
